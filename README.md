# ESP32 Alpaca Kasa Switch

An ESP32-based ASCOM Alpaca driver that provides seamless integration between TP-Link Kasa smart switches and astronomical software like NINA (Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy).
  
  Jessie Gentry   Devloped by myself for use with all my current Kasa Smart Plugs. Modified to handle child devices. Adaapted to
                  work with Alpaca. Able to scan through setup page all Kasa devices on the network. Stores enabled devices in
                  persistent storage.  Thanks to the following for their contributions to this project:
  KRIS JEARAKUL   The code ESP32AlpacaKasaSwitch for the Kasa smart switch is based on the  originally developed by Kris Jearakul.
                  This version has been adapted to fit into the ESP32AlpacaDevices framework by BigPet.

## Installation

### 1. Hardware Setup
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB
2. Ensure your ESP32 and Kasa devices are on the same WiFi network

### 2. Software Setup

#### Using PlatformIO (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vernalequinox-obc/ESP32AlpacaKasaSwitch.git
cd ESP32AlpacaKasaSwitch

# Open in PlatformIO
code .  # or open with your preferred editor

# Configure WiFi credentials in src/Config.h
# Build and upload
pio run --target upload
```

#### Using Arduino IDE
1. Download the project as ZIP and extract
2. Install required libraries through Library Manager
3. Configure WiFi credentials in `src/Config.h`
4. Select your ESP32 board and upload

### 3. WiFi Configuration
Edit `src/Config.h` with your network credentials:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YourWiFiNetwork";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";
```

## How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **Upload Firmware**: Flash the ESP32 with the project code
2. **Power On**: Connect ESP32 to power and wait for WiFi connection
3. **Find IP Address**: Check your router or serial monitor for ESP32's IP address
4. **Access Web Interface**: Open `http://ESP32_IP_ADDRESS/setup/v1/switch/0/setup` in your browser

### Device Discovery and Configuration

1. **Discover Devices**:
   - Click "Discover Kasa Devices" button in web interface
   - Wait for network scan to complete (5-10 seconds)
   - All Kasa devices on your network will be listed

2. **Select Switches**:
   - Toggle switches ON/OFF to enable/disable them for ASCOM use
   - Enabled switches will be available to NINA and other ASCOM clients
   - Each switch shows: Index number, Name, Model, IP address

3. **Save Configuration**:
   - Click "Save" to store your selections
   - Settings persist across power cycles
   - Use "Re-check Saved" to verify saved devices are still reachable

### ASCOM Client Integration

#### NINA Integration
1. **Add Switch Device**:
   - Go to Equipment ‚Üí Switch
   - Add new device: "ASCOM Switch"
   - Select "Alpaca Switch" driver

2. **Configure Connection**:
   - **Host**: ESP32 IP address
   - **Port**: 80 (default)
   - **Device Number**: 0

3. **Switch Naming**:
   - Switches appear as "Index 0: Device Name", "Index 1: Device Name", etc.
   - Use index numbers in NINA Advanced Sequencer for reliable automation

#### Other ASCOM Software
- Use same connection parameters (IP:80, device 0)
- Compatible with SGP, MaxIm DL, TheSkyX, etc.
- Supports standard ASCOM Switch interface

### Web Interface Features

#### Main Configuration Page
- **Device List**: Shows all discovered Kasa switches with details
- **Toggle Controls**: Enable/disable individual switches
- **Status Display**: Shows enabled vs. total device count

#### Control Buttons
- **Discover Kasa Devices**: Scan network for new devices
- **Re-check Saved**: Verify saved devices are still accessible  
- **Save**: Persist current configuration to flash memory

### Network Architecture

```
[NINA/ASCOM Client] ‚Üê‚Üí [ESP32 Alpaca Server] ‚Üê‚Üí [Kasa Smart Switches]
     (WiFi/HTTP)              (WiFi)              (Kasa Protocol)
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Device Limits
- **Maximum Switches**: 15 devices can be discovered and configured
- **Exposed Switches**: Only enabled switches count toward ASCOM MaxSwitch
- **Memory Usage**: ~200 bytes per configured switch

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by editing `src/Switch.h`:
```cpp
#define DEBUG_SWITCH  // Uncomment this line
```

### Custom Network Settings
Modify discovery timeouts in `Switch.cpp` if needed:
```cpp
const unsigned long discovery_timeout = 5500;  // Network scan duration (ms)
const unsigned long broadcast_interval = 900;   // Broadcast frequency (ms)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ESP32 Won't Connect to WiFi
- Verify WiFi credentials in `Config.h`
- Check 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Ensure network allows device-to-device communication

#### Devices Not Discovered
- Confirm Kasa devices are on same network as ESP32
- Check devices work in Kasa mobile app
- Try power cycling Kasa devices
- Verify router allows UDP broadcasts (port 9999)

#### NINA Connection Failed
- Verify ESP32 IP address is correct
- Use port 80 (not 8080 or others)  
- Check firewall settings on computer
- Ensure ESP32 and computer are on same network

#### Switches Don't Respond
- Use "Re-check Saved" to verify device connectivity
- Check device IP addresses haven't changed (DHCP)
- Verify devices aren't in use by Kasa app simultaneously

### Debug Information
Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
1. Uncomment `#define DEBUG_SWITCH` in `Switch.h`
2. Recompile and upload
3. Monitor serial output at 115200 baud
4. Debug logs show device communication details
